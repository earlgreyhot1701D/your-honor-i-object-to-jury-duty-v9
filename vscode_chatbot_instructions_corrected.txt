# 🚀 How to Run This Jury Chatbot in VS Code (Local Setup)

This guide walks you through launching the AI-powered jury chatbot on your local machine using Visual Studio Code.

---

## ✅ 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- AWS credentials already configured (for Bedrock)
- Internet connection

## 📁 2. Open the Folder in VS Code

1. Unzip the chatbot folder (e.g., `jury-chatbot-v9.zip`)

## 🐍 3. Set Up Your Virtual Environment

In the VS Code Terminal:

## 🔐 4. Fix PowerShell Script Policy (if needed)

If you use PowerShell and see a script execution error, run this **before** activating the environment:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

> Only do this once per user account if needed.

---

## ▶️ 5. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # PowerShell (recommended)
```

If using Git Bash or Command Prompt, use:
```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate    # Git Bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # CMD
```

## 📦 6. Install Dependencies

Once activated, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
